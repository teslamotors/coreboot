	  Select this option to add FCH SPI controller functions to the build.
	  This overwrites the structure spi_flash_ops to use FCH SPI code
	  instead of individual SPI specific code.

	  SPI read mode to be programmed by the PSP.
	  The numbers in the options below indicate how many wires
	  are utilized for command, address and data. For instance 1-1-2
	  means 1 command, 1 address and 2 data wires.
	    0: Normal Read (up to 33M)
	    1: Reserved
	    2: Dual IO (1-1-2)
	    3: Quad IO (1-1-4)
	    4: Dual IO (1-2-2)
	    5: Quad IO (1-4-4)

	    0: Board does not use Micron parts
